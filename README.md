## Specifications ##

* Create a View to display inside of a block on your front page

* Make the View display an unformatted list of linked titles for your choice of content: articles, or your site's custom content type.

* Ajax enable the links in your view.

* Create a block with a wrapper div in it to display whichever title you've clicked on in your view using ajax.

* Create a custom module to handle the ajax calls and load the content into the div.

* Create a custom module which presents a form where the user can enter in one half of their DNA helix. Your module should generate the other half and print both sides on the browser. There is no need to use Ajax on this part of the project.

* Start with writing unit tests before writing your module logic, and start with simple input output pairs. Then write the module and include a functional test to make sure the whole interface works.

* Remember to validate the input. You should only allow your user to type in the letters A, T, C, G.
